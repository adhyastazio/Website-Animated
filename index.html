        <h2>üìú About Me </h2>
        <p>
          Highly motivated and ambitious final-year Geological Engineering student with a deep passion for Geotechnics and Machine Learning. Equipped with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics, acquired through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects at Bangkit Academy, where I was part of the prestigious Machine Learning Cohort led by industry giants Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka.
        </p>

        <p>
          My hands-on experience in real-world projects has equipped me with the practical skills necessary to analyze geological data, model geotechnical problems, and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. I am adept at integrating geological insights with advanced Machine Learning algorithms to deliver innovative and efficient solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eager to contribute my skills and passion to a forward-thinking organization, I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my unique blend of Geotechnical and Machine Learning expertise.
